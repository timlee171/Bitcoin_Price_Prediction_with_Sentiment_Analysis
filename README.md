# Bitcoin_price_prediction_with_Sentiment_Analysis
## Abstract:
Predicting stock price is always a hot topic in the Machine learning field, including predicting the cryptocurrency market. Due to its volatility, it is a challenging task that no one can predict the future price accurately. Nowadays, people use social media to express their opinions such as Twitter and Reddit. We found that stock price movements are strongly correlated to public sentiment. Previous papers also proved that sentiment analysis is an effective method to improve the accuracy of prediction. Among all the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the leading crypto, which has great influence on the whole market. The thesis of the work is to use sentiment analysis with multiple social media sentiment comments to improve the accuracy of predicting Bitcoin price. Along with sentiment analysis, the present paper uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to train the model, and we use RMSE to examine the results. Experiments training with different features are conducted to compare the importance of the features, a total of 5 experiments. In the end, the results show that exploiting more social media dataset results in lower RMSE.
