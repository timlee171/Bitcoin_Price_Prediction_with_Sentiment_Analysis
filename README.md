# Bitcoin_price_prediction_with_Sentiment_Analysis
# Abstract
Predicting stock price is always a hot topic in the Machine learning field, including predicting the cryptocurrency market. Due to its volatility, it is a challenging task that no one can predict the future price accurately. Nowadays, people use social media to express their opinions such as Twitter and Reddit. We found that stock price movements are strongly correlated to public sentiment. Previous papers also proved that sentiment analysis is an effective method to improve the accuracy of prediction. Among all the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is the leading crypto, which has great influence on the whole market. The thesis of the work is to use sentiment analysis with multiple social media sentiment comments to improve the accuracy of predicting Bitcoin price. Along with sentiment analysis, the present paper uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to train the model, and we use RMSE to examine the results. Experiments training with different features are conducted to compare the importance of the features, a total of 6 experiments. In the end, the results show that exploiting more social media dataset results in lower RMSE.

# Introduction
Bitcoin is a popular stock in the cryptocurrency market in the recent year. Since 2009 the bitcoin was first introduced to the market, its value starting from 0.0008 USD, went up to the peak of 60000 USD, which was millions times of the original price. More people had closely followed Bitcoin and joined the cryptocurrency market. The prediction of Bitcoin became a hot topic in the data science field. However,  due to its high volatility, price prediction becomes a difficult task, and many data scientists try to find the best way to train a model with high accuracy. Based on previous studies, considering only historical data as an input was not good enough in training the model. On the other hand, other studies showed that the cryptocurrency market was  heavily influenced by new and  recent events. Because of the unpredictable news and events, stock prices do not follow a pattern and cannot be predicted with more than 50% accuracy. 
Nowadays, people heavily rely on social media and it becomes part of our lives. It is also a good resource to find data and do further social science research. In the data science field, social media such as Reddit and Twitter can provide lots of social data, including public sentiment comments. In Reddit, a Bitcoin subgroup is created just for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency information. In Twitter, more than millions users post over 140 millions tweets every day. Each tweet contains 140 characters and it can hashtag the topic to make it available to more people. Many influencers in the cryptocurrency market declare their personal comment in Twitter and Reddit. Oftentimes, these tweets or reddit posts influence the market immediately. With public sentiment reports, the model can learn the correlation of sentiment with certain incidents happening in the cryptocurrency  market and reflect the influence on the price.
